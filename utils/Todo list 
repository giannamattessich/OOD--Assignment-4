At least one example PPM image (different from any of the ones provided to you in this assignment),
its greyscaled, brighter, darker and flipped (one of each type) versions, named suitably in a
res/ folder

A text README file explaining your design. Your README file should give the graders an overview
of what the purposes are for every class, interface, etc. that you include in your submission,
so that they can quickly get a high-level overview of your code. It does not replace the need
for proper Javadoc!

A script of commands that your program will accept, that will load at least one file, run some
operations on it and save results in other files. Include in your README file instructions on how
 we can run this script using your program (e.g. ''provide this file as a command line argument",
  ''type this script when the program runs", etc.).

A citation for the source of your image (in the README file). It is your responsibility to ensure
that you are legally allowed to use any images, and your citation should be detailed enough for us
to access the image and read its terms of usage. If an image is your own photograph or other
 original work, specify that you own it and are authorizing its use in the project. Please do
  not use images provided or shown in this assignment as your examples.
